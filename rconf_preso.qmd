Hook/armchair covid story: in 2020 we all sort of became arm chair
experts .....if you were thinking COVID, then you and I are thinking the
same thing

sometimes we forget just how much we know, or we might be "masters" of
different things

maybe put this after the "what data are" slides??

"this is a common blind spot for people executing at a high level" we're
all "experts" (or on the spectrum of 'expert') in something

::: notes
Like a good party invite, it's a lot more fun if you've got all the
details down (unless surprise party, but someone should have the details
then) Make clear the ref/analogy to party invite (highlight diff
aspects) We're going to cover all of this (but maybe not in this order)

::: notes

"worth noting that" line from novice to expert may not be at all
straight, and that it's not a single line. It probably more looks like a
swirling, multi-branched tree/plant root ("choose your own adventure"
style) --\> because we all might be "experts" in diff things, it's
worthwhile sharing what we know! remember, quote from before about
common blindspots!

Use this as a "real quick let's clarify who is a "data" person" moment
to say why I've been putting quotes around it

**Maybe consider putting this before the 'why'? Feels like a back
tracking...so be careful about that** a. Who is a "non data" --\> **do I
need to incl this? --\> can make short/quick** (mention this is why
there are quotes around it) b. usually self-designated (I think
anyone/everyone can be a data person, but on a spectrum; we aren't/don't
have to be at same level) c. who you should be talking to 1. if you work
in an org, talk with people not on your team, or people that you may
work w/ obliquely

::: notes
what to say depends on level of person/where they are on data
    spectrum Like are we going full on theme party (maybe into the weeds
    on a ML model) or staying a bit more high level with some small talk
    (maybe get excited about an interesting data journalism article on
    music taste you saw float by on Twitter recently) The "what" could
    be educational, it could be entertaining, it could be both ('pique
    the curiosity'). Depends on the rest of the party invite

## {background-image="imgs/Where_When.png"}

::: notes
Consider: Is this a last minute backyard hangout or a wedding planned
months in advance? The where/when and what might also inform the others.
E.g. if you want/need to deep dive on something to bridge
understanding/knowledge gap, it makes sense to set up time in advance to
discuss, so the audience has some sense of what they are getting into.
If you're casually bringing it up in a way to entertain/show another
side of data (e.g. a new/unexpected place to find data, or a creative
data use), the where/when might be over lunch, or a brief meeting in a
hallway, or maybe even something you share on social media (??)

a.  lol always and forever
b.  in seriousness: where could be small doses?
c.  when: pre-emptive meetings
d.  consider where people encounter data/viz

## {background-image="imgs/Sci_Art.png"}

::: notes
TODO: consider putting this slide after "who"?? this one's pretty
important, so we're starting w/ it first

"data are art + science"; so much more than just numbers (can be charts,
vizzes, categories, counts, used for/tracked on/predicted for so many
things Maybe Transition: so because there are so many different ways to
interpret "what data is" there's also a lot of misconceptions about it.
So it's important to talk about data with everyone, not just those who
are "data people"

## WHY- accessibility {background-image="imgs/Background.png"}

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

penguins %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  #summarise(across(ends_with('mm')),.fun=mean)
  glimpse
  #kable::kab
```

(will have table of numbers --> viz of numbers)

::: notes
TODO: make image of table of numbers --\> viz (use palmer penguins as
example). make something for these 4: (in text, in table, in single
stats, in viz) of palmer penguins. Maybe incl slide before one with all
4 things of penguins wandering gif/pushing each other into ice

you could go out an count penguins all day, and maybe that's what you
do. but if that was the only way to learn about them for everyone, then
we might not get too far. we rely on others' data to summarize, to
count, to understand the world around us. and if we present data in
different ways (in text, in table, in single stats, in viz) we'll be
able to understand different aspects/maybe learn something new

this is just one example of how data can be used as an accessibility
tool. numbers themselves can be a way to summarise information, and if
we show numbers/data in a particular way, it can make the info more (or
less) clear and accessible to folks.

Mention accessibility (maybe elaborate in the how section) HOW DOES
ACCESSIBILITY FACTOR IN? --\> **TBD on including this??** --\> yes,
include! in maybe where or why or how Visualizations themselves are an
accessibility tool, rather than looking at a block of numbers in a
spreadsheet or table. Of course, there are lots of ways to make
visualizations more/less accessible (that's a topic for a whole other
talk and there area numerous resources available, so we won't get too in
the weeds there) By realizing what data literacy is and why it's
important for us all to have some level of it, we (looking at those who
are deeper in the tech/data world) can lend a hand to others.

## HOW {background-image="imgs/Background.png"}

TODO: make slide. this will be mostly text/links for learning more 

::: notes
6.  how end w/ practical tips Twitter? Famous data ppl? Ask team? ïƒ 
    maybe talk about process of gathering this info, it's a collective
    effort/convo (no one is gatekeeper to everything/knows everything
    about this; there's always something new to learn which keeps it
    exciting)

just get started? will feel awk, but just need to jump in and do it

share anecdotal story of talking to guy for STR
:::

## {background-image="imgs/End_Story.png"}

::: notes
WHY (REMINDER + STORY) TODO: think of what I want visually on this slide
to tell the story...maybe screenshot from what I shared with creatives?
maybe image of my data portraits? (inspired by giorgia lupi, shared w/
my team b/c bored/covid/thought we'd go back to office sooner. word got
around and I ) 7. end w/ final wrap up/remind ppl the WHY a. want ppl to
walk away and feel inspired to go share data passion/excitement w/
others b. end w/ story about sharing data w/ \[creative\] coworkers
(they didn't realize data could be so much more than
reporting/analytics. and when others see the inspiration/possibilities,
we can do cooler things with data!!)
